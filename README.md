# Question3
The database constraints comprises of VARBINARY as the encoded string needs 
to be stored in a special data format.

Also , I have used a predefined function i.e base64_encode($string) in order
to encode a data format and to decode it's base64_decode($string).

Used both of these in the program.Although we can go for advance functions
as well which comprises of key for providing extra security.
